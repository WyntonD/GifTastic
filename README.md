This project involved retrieving data from an external source using AJAX calls for gif displays. It involved a simple manipulation of both arrays and jQuery functions to populate the site with various gifs when searched. A major challenge was figuring out how to pause and animate the gifs when being clicked on. This was resolved by setting up a conditional that altered the data-state within the image attribute, allowing for gifs to freeze and re-animate.
